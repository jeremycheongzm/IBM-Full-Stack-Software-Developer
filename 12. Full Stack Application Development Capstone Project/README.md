# Full Stack Application Development Capstone Project
## Part 1: Static Pages
Congratulations on your new role as the Lead Cloud Application Developer at the "Best Cars" dealership. As a warm-up task, you need to run and test its main Django application.

The Django app will be mainly used for user management and authentication, managing car models and makes, and routing other MongoDB services for dealership and customer reviews. You will build this Django app and related services in a phased manner along the capstone course. 

In this module, you are asked to perform the following tasks:
- Fork the GitHub repo containing the project template.
- Clone your forked repository.
- Run the Django app on the development server.
- Add a navigation to the website using Bootstrap.
- Add an "About Us" static page.
- Add a "Contact Us" static page.

## Part 2: User Management
Now, you have the initial Django application built and deployed. In the next step, the admins of the dealership will review the app to identify users and manage their accesses based on roles (such as anonymous users or registered users). 

To accomplish this, you need to add authentication and authorization, that is, user management, to the app. In this lesson, you need to perform the following tasks to add the user management feature: 
- Create a superuser for your app.
- Build the Client side and configure it.
- Check the Client configuration.
- Add a Login view to handle login requests.
- Add a Logout view to handle logout requests.
- Add a Registration view to handle Sign-up requests.
