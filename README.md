### This repository contains my final project submissions for the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certification, started on 8 October 2025.

# IBM-Full-Stack-Software-Developer
Prepare for a career in the high-growth field of software development. In this program, you’ll learn in-demand skills and tools for front-end, back-end, and cloud native application development to get job-ready in less than 4 months.

## Program Overview
Full stack refers to the end-to-end computer system application, including the front end and back end coding. 
Cloud native development refers to developing a program designed to work on cloud architecture. The flexibility and adaptability that full stack and cloud native developers provide make them highly sought after in this digital world. You'll also have the option to learn how generative AI tools and techniques are used in software development.

You’ll learn how to **build, deploy, test, run, and manage full stack cloud native applications**. Technologies covered includes Cloud foundations, GitHub, Node.js, React, CI/CD, Containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Istio, Databases, NoSQL, Django Object-Relational Mapping(ORM), Bootstrap, Application Security, Microservices, Serverless computing, and more. 

After completing the program you will have developed several applications using front-end and back-end technologies and deployed them on a cloud platform using Cloud Native methodologies. You will publish these projects through your GitHub repository to share your portfolio with your peers and prospective employers.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout the courses in the Professional Certificate, you will develop a portfolio of hands-on projects involving various popular technologies and programming languages in Full Stack Cloud Application Development. These projects include creating:
