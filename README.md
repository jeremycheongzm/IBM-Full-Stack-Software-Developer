# Final Project Overview
## Final Project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Application
For your final project, you will create the front end of a "Paradise Nursery" shopping application. The application interface will allow you to browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart feature lets you see all your items and their total cost. Your shopping cart should also allow you to adjust the number of items in the cart before checkout.

Completing the practice project will help you with the final project. We designed it so that many of the components, code, and skills for that project can be transferred to this peer-reviewed project with some updates.

Your application should have three pages: a landing page, a product listing page, and a shopping cart page. See the lab for details on the specific functionality requirements on each page. The product walkthrough video also demonstrates how your completed project should look and behave.

### Landing page
The landing page should have the following elements:
- A background image
- A paragraph about the company
- The company name
- A **Get Started** button linking to the product page

The product listing page should have at least six houseplants for sale, organized into three or more categories. Each plant should have the following details about it:
- A thumbnail image
- Plant name
- Price
- An **Add to Cart** button

### Product listing page
The product listing and shopping cart pages should have a header. The header should have a shopping cart icon with a number that updates dynamically, displaying the total number of items in the cart. The header should also contain navigation to either of the other pages, depending on which page you are on.

### Shopping cart page
The shopping cart page displays all the details about the items in it. It should prominently display the total number of plants in the cart, the total cost of all items in the cart, a continue shopping button, and a checkout button.

On this page, you should be able to see each type of plant in the shopping cart, including its thumbnail and name. You should also display its unit price and the total of all the items in the cart. You should provide an increase or decrease button to change the number of that plant type in the cart, which also updates the shopping cart icon in the header and the total number of items in the cart. Finally, you should also include a delete button for each type of plant in the cart.

### This repository contains my final project submissions for the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certification, started on 8 October 2025.

# IBM-Full-Stack-Software-Developer
Prepare for a career in the high-growth field of software development. In this program, you’ll learn in-demand skills and tools for front-end, back-end, and cloud native application development to get job-ready in less than 4 months.

## Program Overview
Full stack refers to the end-to-end computer system application, including the front end and back end coding. 
Cloud native development refers to developing a program designed to work on cloud architecture. The flexibility and adaptability that full stack and cloud native developers provide make them highly sought after in this digital world. You'll also have the option to learn how generative AI tools and techniques are used in software development.

You’ll learn how to **build, deploy, test, run, and manage full stack cloud native applications**. Technologies covered includes Cloud foundations, GitHub, Node.js, React, CI/CD, Containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Istio, Databases, NoSQL, Django ORM, Bootstrap, Application Security, Microservices, Serverless computing, and more. 

After completing the program you will have developed several applications using front-end and back-end technologies and deployed them on a cloud platform using Cloud Native methodologies. You will publish these projects through your GitHub repository to share your portfolio with your peers and prospective employers.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout the courses in the Professional Certificate, you will develop a portfolio of hands-on projects involving various popular technologies and programming languages in Full Stack Cloud Application Development. These projects include creating:

- HTML pages on Cloud Object Storage
- An interest rate calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- An AI program deployed on Cloud Foundry using DevOps principles and CI/CD toolchains with a NoSQL database
- A Node.js back-end application and a React front-end application
- A containerized guestbook app packaged with Docker deployed with Kubernetes and managed with OpenShift
- A Python app bundled as a package
- A database-powered application using Django ORM and Bootstrap
- An app built using Microservices & Serverless
- A scalable, Cloud Native Full Stack application using the technologies learned in previous courses
